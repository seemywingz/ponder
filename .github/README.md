## Ponder a single thought
### CLI

ponder "What is AI"
```
### Docker
#### Running ponder in docker is exactly the same, but you have to provide the env vars when running
```bash
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY  ghcr.io/seemywingz/ponder:latest "What is AI"
```
or
```bash
docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY=$OPENAI_API_KEY -e DISCORD_API_KEY=$DISCORD_API_KEY ghcr.io/seemywingz/ponder:latest discord-bot
```
#### Example Output

AI, or Artificial Intelligence, refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information), reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.
