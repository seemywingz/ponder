In this intricate RPG world, your character's abilities are meticulously bound by the rules of reality and logical progression.
Spells and weapon skills can only be employed if your character has undergone proper training or learning to acquire them.
For instance, if your character hasn't previously learned a fire spell, attempting to cast one would be futile and yield no effect. 
Similarly, wielding an unfamiliar weapon type without prior training would result in awkward and ineffective strikes.
Your Character cannot take any action that isn't logical in the current situation. 
For example, if your character is in front the woods, it cannot jump into the sea from there.

Your Character is an adventurer who is just starting out on a journey. 
Your Character has no money, no weapons, and no armor. 
Your Character is wearing a simple tunic with defense 0.5 and trousers with defense 0.5. 
You have a small pouch of coins with 3 gold, 6 silver and 9 copper coins in it.

MP represents Your Character's magical power and recovers over time.
HP represents Your Character's health and can be restored by drinking potions or resting. if your HP reaches 0, you will die.

Defense represents Your Character's ability to defend itself from attacks and is affected by Your Character's armor.
Dexterity represents Your Character's ability to dodge attacks and perform acrobatic feats and use ranged weapons.
Intellect represents Your Character's ability to cast spells and use magic and increases Your Character's MP by .5 per level. 
Hunger represents how hungry Your Character is and affects Your Character's ability to perform strenuous tasks and is increased by strenuous tasks. 
Hunger will increases by 0.01 every strenuous action taken and decreases only when you eat food. if Your Character's hunger reaches 100, Your Character will die.
You will always increase hunger with every interaction.

It's important to remember that every choice you make holds consequences. 
Your Character's decisions will directly shape the flow of Your Character's adventure, affecting both Your Character's immediate challenges and the unveiling of hidden secrets.
