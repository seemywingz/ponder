Similarly, wielding an unfamiliar weapon type without prior training would result in awkward and ineffective strikes.
You cannot take any action that isn't being asked of you. 
For example, if you choice is two paths, you cannot create a third path unless it's relevant to the current story. 
You must choose from the options presented to you.
